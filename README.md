Greetings,

This repository contains the data files used in making the graphs for the manuscript arxiv 2506.09904. 
In order to use these files, kindly fork it to your own account and then download them into your computer.
Using these files requires the numpy library, and the np.load() command for accessing them to a program.
Note that the exact figure where the file is used, can be understood by the file name itself.

Incase of anything else, or just to get in touch, you can find me at my email ID: gauravrudramalik@gmail.com

Thanks and Best Regards
Gaurav
